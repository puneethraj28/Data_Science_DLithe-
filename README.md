# Data_Science_DLithe-
Hello, These are my DataScience Projects .

Here I worked with some different datasets, Analyzed, Applied some datascience operation & Tried to represent Data.

# Needs of this project
 Data processing/cleanin, Data exploration/descriptive statistics, Statistical modelling

1) DataScience_Internship_Car : In this project I imported the Car dataset  which contains details about car 
   & applied some dataframe basic operation,& also applied random forest regression algorithm to train and test the model.
   Plotted 3D plot for year,Present price& KMs driven.Plotted Bar plot for owner,transmission etc..
 
2) DataScience_Internship_Fish :  In this project I imported the Fish dataset  which contains details about Fish 
   & applied nifty functions, dataframe basic operation & used iloc functions to find location.Created scatter plot graphs.
   
3) DataScience_Internship_GPU :  In this project I imported the sigmma product dataset & applied dataframe 
   basic operation & used iloc functions to find location.Plotted bar graphs.Also applied random forest regression algorithm 
   to train and test the model.
   
4) DataScience_Internship_Prices :  In this project I imported the prices dataset & applied dataframe basic operation 
   & Extracted GOOGLE stock data and analyzed it. used iloc functions.Plotted axes subplot graphs.
   Used Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks are capable of learning other dependence in sequence prediction problems.
   Also applied random forest regression algorithm to train and test the model.r2 scoore is used to determine the  accuracy,mean squared
   error is also calculated
